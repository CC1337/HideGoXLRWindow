# HideGoXLRWindow
 
This little solution hides the GoXLR App window on startup since there is no way to do that from the software itself

## How To Install
Just pull down the `HideGoXLR.ps1`, `HideGoXLR_startup.cmd` and `install.bat` files and run the install. You can inspect anything in there, no funny stuff is going on.

The only thing that will happen is it will trigger a little PowerShell script (thanks to @avodovnik) that tries to find any GoXLR windows and closes them on startup. üëè
With the install file it moves the files in the right folders to line it up for startup, only for the current user
